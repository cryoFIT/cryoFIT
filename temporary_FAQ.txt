Doo Nam observe cc values keep decreasing (or do not increase that much) during step 8
 
Initial few steps of cryo_fit in step 8 may decrease cc values temporarily as an initial perturbation.

However, if it keeps decreasing continuously (or do not increase that much), it may indicate two possible reasons.

  If a user input pdb file has reasonable structural geometry. Then, probablay, the initial correlation between user input pdb file and cryo-EM map is already high enough. Since cryo_fit considers physically reasonable energy conformation based on MD forcefield (amber03.ff), if the initial cc is already high, cryo_fit may decrease cc eventually. If a user deems his/her input pdb file has a reasonable geometry yet cryo_fit can't find better(higher) cc, then cryo_fit may not be necessary. Just run phenix.real_space_refine only and deposit. Doo Nam recommends to argue/claim in a paper like "our fit is so high, even cryo_fit didn't find higher level of fit", because cryo_fit automatically increases emweight_multiply_by if it doesn't find higher cc. Therefore, if cryo_fit can't find higher cc even with its higher emweight_multiply_by, it may mean that current fitting is pretty good.
  
  If a user input pdb file has unreasonable structural geometry. Although the fit between atomic model and map looks good, it is a fictitious fitting without considering ideal geometry. Run cryo_fit to find decent fit to the cryo-EM map along maintaining reasonable structural geometry.


There are four possible solutions
  
  1. Providing higher (better) resolution map tends to help this problem.
  
  2. Enforcing stronger map weight tends to help this problem.
  
  3. If cryo_fit is provided a giant cryoem map with a tiny atomic model.
    Then, the cryo_fit calculates the gradient of CC because of the large empty space not filled. The constraint forces for the model are not helping as they are very small.
    3-1. Re-run cryo_fit with an atomic model that fits the majority of the map.
         Fit multiple atomic models into a symmetric map or sequential fitting into a non-symmetric map. Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VGYo1pRRZ8&t=0s&list=PLVetO1F9gm_oa--j37yrjzJ4yVJYzPVN5&index=12
    3-2. Re-run cryo_fit with only relevant map region. A user can extract relevant map region by phenix.map_box (preferred) or phenix.map_to_model

  4. If the initial model is not properly aligned to a map, fit using UCSF Chimera -> Tools -> Volume Data -> Fit in Map
